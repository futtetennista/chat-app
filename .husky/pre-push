# This script identifies JavaScript and TypeScript files that have been changed
# between the current HEAD and the specified remote branch. It filters out deleted
# files and sorts the list of changed files in a unique, alphabetical order.
# The resulting list includes files with the following extensions: .js, .jsx, .ts, .tsx.
# Sorting is not strictly necessary, it's a workaround to swallow non-zero codes that grep
# returns if no match is found so that the command always returns a zero code.
